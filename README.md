<h2 > About The Project </h2>

In today's fast-paced academic environment, students often face challenges in grasping complex topics, condensing vast amounts of notes, and effectively testing their knowledge. The AI Study Buddy is a web application designed to tackle these problems head-on. It provides a suite of AI-powered tools that act as a personal tutor, available 24/7.

This application leverages the power of Large Language Models to provide contextual explanations, generate concise summaries, and create interactive quizzes, transforming a static study process into a dynamic and conversational experience.

<h2 > Key Features </h2>

<h3>üí¨ Conversational Concept Explainer : </h3> Don't just get a definition, have a conversation! Ask about a complex topic and then ask follow-up questions until you fully understand it. The AI maintains context for a natural tutoring experience.

<h3>üìù Interactive Notes Summarizer : </h3>Paste your lengthy study notes and receive a well-structured summary. You can then ask the AI to elaborate on specific points, simplify sections, or extract key terms from the original text.

<h3>üß† Dynamic Quiz Generator : </h3>Turn any topic into a learning opportunity. Generate a 10-question multiple-choice quiz to test your knowledge, receive your score, and review the correct answers to reinforce learning.
